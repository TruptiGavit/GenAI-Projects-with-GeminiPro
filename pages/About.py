    Hello There,
    I'm Trupti Gurudatta Gavit, a graduate from IIT Bombay. I've recently developed a strong interest in Generative AI. I've been diving deep into this field, taking courses and learning as much as I can. It's an exciting journey that combines technology with creativity. Before this, I've worked in different roles, like helping with research projects and managing communities. But now, my focus is on exploring the possibilities of AI. I'm eager to apply what I've learned to contribute to the world of Generative AI. It's all about pushing boundaries and making new discoveries.
